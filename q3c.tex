$d(C) = 2t + 1 =3$ for $C$ with $t=1$ in this case. So, the incomplete decoding scheme guarantees the correction of $\leq t,\; \leq 1$ errors in any codeword.
\qsubpart
Given the received vector $\bm{y} = 111111$ which appears in the bottom part of Table~\ref{tab:15} we conclude that more than one error has occurred during transmission and request the resending of the codeword.
\qsubpart
Given the received vector $\bm{y} =110011$ which appears in the top row of the upper part of Table~\ref{tab:15} we conclude that no errors have occurred and decode the received vector as the codeword $110011$.
\qsubpart
Given the received vector $\bm{y} = 111101$ which appears in the upper part of Table~\ref{tab:15}, in a row other than the top row, we conclude that one error has occurred and decode the vector as the codeword $111100$.
